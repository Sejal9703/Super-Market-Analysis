Developed the "Superstore Sales Insight" dashboard using Excel and Power BI. Key performance indicators (KPIs) include sales,
orders, profit, shipping days, and returns. The dashboard provides insights into sales and profit by month, sales by category 
and subcategory, and payment methods. The second page features a sales forecast and a breakdown of sales by states.
